We analyzed 102 mobile devices' camera quality to create a guide for users and companies. Our study included examining technical specifications, conducting objective tests, and collecting user opinions from internet reviews. The goal is to provide valuable information for informed purchases and improved product development.

The project combines sentiment analysis techniques with linear regression and clustering to find the words in the reviews and compare the objective and subjective perception of the smartphone's camera quality.
